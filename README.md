Here’s a detailed description emphasizing the backend components:

### Architecture Overview

- **Layered Architecture**: The application follows a layered architecture pattern, which separates concerns into different layers, enhancing maintainability and scalability. The main layers include the presentation layer, service layer, and data access layer.

- **Lombok**: Lombok is utilized to reduce boilerplate code in the Java classes, making the codebase cleaner and more readable by automatically generating getters, setters, and other common methods.

- **Facade Pattern**: The service layer implements the Facade pattern, providing a simplified interface to complex subsystems. This pattern helps in encapsulating the business logic and exposing only necessary functionalities to the presentation layer.

- **Adapter Pattern**: The Adapter pattern is used in the data transfer layer to facilitate communication between different data formats and structures, ensuring smooth data handling and conversion.

- **Spring Boot Transactions**: The application leverages Spring Boot’s transaction management capabilities to ensure data integrity. It manages transactions declaratively, allowing for consistent and reliable data operations.

- **Spring Boot Services**: Services are defined as Spring components, encapsulating the business logic and interacting with the repository layer. This promotes separation of concerns and enhances testability.

- **JPA Repository**: The application uses Java Persistence API (JPA) repositories for data access. This provides a powerful way to manage relational data in Java applications through object-relational mapping (ORM).

- **Java Persistence**: Java Persistence is employed to manage the lifecycle of entities and facilitate database interactions, ensuring that the data model aligns with the underlying database schema.

- **Annotations**: Various annotations are used throughout the codebase, including `@Entity`, `@Repository`, `@Service`, and `@Transactional`, to define the behavior of classes and methods, simplifying configuration and enhancing clarity.

This backend architecture ensures a robust, maintainable, and scalable solution for managing the complexities of an e-commerce application.
